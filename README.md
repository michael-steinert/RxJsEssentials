# RxJs Essentials

- RxJs is a Library for reactive Programming using Observables

## Pipe

- A Pipe is a Pipeline of Operators that process Data from Observables

## Observable

- An Observable can emit multiple Sorts of Data
- RxJs is processing the Data of an Observable and provides a different Output

## Observer

- An Observer is responsible to check the End Result (processed Data or Error) of the Processing after the Pipeline is done
- The Data go from the Observable through the Pipe (all Operators) to the Observer
